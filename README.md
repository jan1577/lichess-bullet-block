# lichess-bullet-block

A Chrome Extension to remove Bullet Games from lichess.org.

Bullet Games are addictive - this Chrome extension stops you from wasting your time by chasing the next dopamine push.
It removes all options to start a Bullet Game, only allowing Blitz, Rapid, Classical and Variants.

## Setup
Clone the repository or download as a ZIP-file and unzip. Make sure to name the foler "LichessBulletBlock". Next, go to chrome://extensions/ and turn on developer mode. 
Click "Load unpacked" and upload the folder. After installing, you can turn off developer mode.
